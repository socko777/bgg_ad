						               													<description>Breaking Demon&amp;rsquo;s Contract is a dark, emotional cooperative card game that draws players into a world where friendship is the only weapon against inner torment. One of your own&amp;mdash;the Possessed&amp;mdash;is being consumed by a hidden Demon. To save them, players must build trust, confront emotional wounds, and uncover the truth buried within.

Gameplay
Designed for 2&amp;ndash;4 players, the game revolves around strategic card play, resource management, and team coordination. Players gain Friendship Points to unlock the ability to Talk It Out&amp;mdash;a critical moment that reveals the Demon. Once revealed, the Demon becomes more powerful, triggering effects and escalating tension. Each round is framed by a Diurnal Cycle, representing limited time before the Possessed is lost for good.

Goal
Players must work together to heal the Possessed, endure unpredictable events, and deal damage to the Demon using action cards. Victory comes only if the Demon is defeated before time runs out. Fail, and the Possessed is lost to darkness.

Tone &amp; Feel
While rich in theme, the game emphasizes teamwork, planning, and clever card play over storytelling. Expect tension, tough decisions, and satisfying cooperation&amp;mdash;not a narrative, but an experience shaped by your choices.
