						               													<description>Everyone in this surreal apartment building loves rumors and especially loves gossiping about them with their neighbors.
Your goal is to come up with the best background story for a given rumor that is spreading around town and get crowned as the Rumor Freak.

HOW TO PLAY

     Every player chooses a character and takes the corresponding


Character Card in front of them, along with a marker.

     A random player starts the game by saying, "Rumor has it that... and draws one card from each deck, placing each card faceup in the following order to complete a sentence: WHO &gt; DID WHAT&gt; WHO &gt; SPICY DETAIL. This player is now the active player.
     Start the sand timer. All players (including the active player) have 1 minute to come up with a scenario and a background story for the rumor (why it happened, how things ended up that way, secret motives, or whatever you like). Be as bizarre and disturbing as you can be. Keep notes on your Dry-Erase Card so that you don't forget.
     Once the sand timer is up, each player unravels their story, starting with the active player and moving clockwise. Try to be as convincing as you can and persuade everyone you have the real story.
     Then, every player votes for the best story by writing their favorite character name on their card. And no, you cannot vote for yourself.
     When everyone is ready, reveal your votes. Every player gets as many points as the votes he/she has received. If someone is voted by all, he/she gets one extra point.
     Circle the number of points you received on the numberline of your Character Card and update it after every round to keep track of your total points.
     With each new round, someone new becomes the active player.
     The game ends when all players have been the active player once (for 5-6 players) or twice (for 3-4 players).
     The player with the most points is deemed the absolute Rumor Freak of the Town.


FUN FACT: If the WHO card starts with "my" (example, my mom) we're talking about the active player's real mom. Not their character's mom. Their real mom. Enjoy the chaos.

SPICE UP THE GAME
Looking to spice up the game even more?
Instead of drawing the first WHO card, the active player can come up with a person they know (famous or not) and write it out on the WHO Dry-Erase Card.
