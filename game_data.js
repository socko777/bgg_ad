Lauded by both the public and critics, 7 Wonders has claimed its place as an unmissable reference point in modern board gaming. 7 Wonders is based on a simple and elegant mechanic (drafting) which allows up to 7 players to play with no dead time. Players make their choice and apply all of them at the same time. These choices are varied and their impact is real. Finally, the game is divided into 3 Ages which little by little increase the importance of these choices and thus the tension in the game. The global mechanics and the care given to the artwork are used to immerse the player in Antiquity and have contributed to the game's success.\nA game plays out over 3 rounds, called Ages, during which you simultaneously play cards, one at a time, to develop your City.\n\nThese cards represent the various Buildings you can construct: resource producers, civilian, commercial, military, scientific structures, and guilds.\n\nAt the end of each Age, you go to war with your nearest neighbours. At the end of all 3 Ages, you tally up all of the victory points earned by your City, your wonder, your military prowess, and your treasury. The player with the highest score wins the game.\n\nContent:\n7 Wonder boards\n148 Age cards: 49 Age I cards, 49 Age II cards, and 50 Age III cards\n78 Coins: 54 Coins of value 1, and 24 Coins of value 3\n48 Military Conflict tokens: 24 Defeats and 24 Victories (8 per Age)\n1 pad of score sheets\n3 quick reference sheets describing the effects of the cards\n1 List of cards and chaining leaflet\n1 rulebook\n\n"

            "description": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders. Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.\n\nPlayers do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.\n\nYou can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n"

Now is your time to move in and extract the valuable resources from its unstable planets &mdash; but these jobs are too dangerous to do alone, so send in teams of Hired Paws and form uneasy truces with your rivals to come away with the best loot.\n\nAfternova is a strategic negotiation game for 3-6 players. Score victory points by collecting fragments shown on your blueprints to build ship upgrades. When a player completes 6 of blueprints, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins.\n\nOn your turn, you may either take 3 cards from the market or extract fragments from a planet. When performing a Market action, you can take any combination of Blueprint and Hired Paw cards. Blueprints are needed to score points, but they also grant special abilities. Hired Paws have different skill sets, so you'll need a variety of Hired Paws to Extract, or help other players Extract. The core of the game is negotiating during an Extract action. When performing an Extract action, you often don't have all the Hired Paws needed to meet the planet's requirement, so you'll likely need to team up with other players to split the work and the rewards.\n\n&mdash;description from the designer\n\n"

Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing the symbols required to claim this card, with the symbols separated into battle lines. The cards are grouped into sets, with sets varying in size from one to four cards.\n\nA player starts their turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show different symbols. They then select a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If they can do this, they then roll the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if they cannot conquer a line, they remove one die from play, the rolls again. Their turn ends when either they conquer every line on the card (in which case they claims it) or they no longer have dice available to roll.\n\nEach card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional line to do so. If a player has claimed all the cards from one set, however, those castles are secure and can no longer be stolen. What's more, these cards are now also worth more points.\n\nWhen the last card is claimed, players tally the points from the cards they have claimed, and whoever has the highest score wins.\n\n"

The game's art brings to life a quirky neighborhood of animal spies.\n\nUse a unique \"I split, you choose\" mechanic to play one card face-up and one face-down each turn. Your opponent chooses one, influencing both your strategies. Cards feature different agents and tools that impact scoring and game progress on a track, advancing the \"catch me\" race to uncover the opposing spy.\n\nOutwit your opponents by strategically collecting agent sets and effectively using spy tools. The game ends when a player successfully uncovers their opponent, combining both strategic depth and bluffing elements.\n\nPerfect for those who love a mix of strategy and lighthearted competition, \"Agent Avenue\" challenges you to think like a spy and act like a friendly neighbor.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n"

Each player starts the game with money cards valued 0-8, and at the start of the game, everyone chooses money cards that sum to 14 (with the 0 being included) and lays those cards face up on the table. Province cards equal to the number of players are revealed, and players take turns bidding on provinces by placing exactly one money card next to one province, outbidding an opponent if someone else has already bid there; if you're outbid, you take back your money card, then bid again on your next turn. Eventually everyone will have bid on separate provinces, after which you discard the non-0 bids, then lay out new province cards and run through two more rounds of bidding.\n\nProvince cards show different numbers of pyramids, ankhs, and fields, with a caravan possibly being visible as well. Whoever has the most ankhs visible is Pharaoh, going first in each action with ties broken from the Pharaoh going clockwise.\n\nAfter three rounds of auctions, players will have some amount of money (possibly only the 0) still in hand. Everyone simultaneously makes an offering of gold, and the sum of the offerings determines how much the Nile floods, which determines how much money players will earn from fields. If the sum is 10 or less, players with caravans receive 10 gold per caravan. Whoever offers the most gold receives three pyramids to place on their province cards, with others receiving two and one pyramids.\n\nIn player order, players determine their income level, then spend gold to build pyramids on their cards (distributing them as equally as possible), then they take money cards into their hand to account for any income not spent. They then score points for sets of pyramids, for having nine or more fields, and for having the most ankhs.\n\nThe second and third rounds of the game play out similarly, except that when you claim cards following the auction, you place these province cards on top of your previous province cards so that only the imprinted and acquired pyramids are visible. Everything else is buried in the sands. You score again at the end of each of these rounds, then the player with the most points wins.\n\n"

Does the symbol on your card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by giving an example of the person, place, or thing on their card before they can do the same for yours. If you blurt out a correct answer first, you win their card and the drawing continues.\n\nSounds simple, right? Wrong! Wild cards allow non-matching symbols to match, increasing the number of things to which you must pay attention. Cascading face-offs can occur when you hand over a lost card, thereby revealing a new top card on your play pile.\n\n"

Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.\n\nWhen the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n"

When either side reaches the top of their track, the Day of Black Sun event is triggered, giving a significant advantage to the side that reached the top.\n\nIn the second phase, players continue as before, but must also now fight the Final Battles at Wulong Forest, the Fire Nation Palace, and Ba Sing Se in an attempt to end the Hundred Year War. Players that stay ahead of the Fire Nation and succeed in all three battles will win the game. If any one team is completely defeated, or if 10 or more total Heroes are defeated, the players cannot stop the Fire Nation and have lost the game.\n At the start of each turn, the active player will choose one of three locations to visit. The Fire Nation will then attack, activating villain abilities in one location, and damaging Heroes in play.\n\nAfter resolving the attack the active player will assemble a pool of dice based on their starting set-up and additional Hero card abilities. Players will roll and assign these dice in order to match symbols on Hero and Team abilities, Hero cards they wish to recruit, Villain cards they want to attack, and in Phase 2 Final Battles they must complete. Players match all of the symbols shown on a card to complete the related task.\n\nThe difficulty level can be adjusted based on players' familiarity with the game and the degree of challenge desired.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n"

Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace.

After use they are not just discarded but put out of play.\n\n\n\n    Deploy Cards: They stay in the players play area and deliver bonuses in different forms every turn.\n\n\n\n    Target Cards: The cities and strategic positions which deliver VPs, also if you conquered strategic positions it becomes easier to attack cities.\n\n\n\n    Event Cards: If you attack the Target cards an event is drawn and stuff happens.\n\n\nLike all of Arclight's deck construction games, the illustrations are provided by famous Japanese fanzine artists.\n\nIntegrates with\n\n    El Alamein\n\n\n"

A family of greedy rural farmers is determined to make its fortune and has devised a diabolical stratagem to achieve this goal: Invest in an inn so they can rob traveling guests, getting rich without arousing the suspicions of the police! Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.\n\nThe Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:\n\n     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)\n     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)\n     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)\n     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)\n     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)\n\n\nAt the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly &mdash; and quietly &mdash; bury the bodies! Lastly in the round, any cards (accomplices) in each player's hand must be paid 1F each. After the guest deck has been depleted the second time, players take a final round, then tally their francs.

In the \"Preparing\" phase, each player buys a card from the market each turn, and cards come in five types: board game, snack, clerk, store, and wi-fi. Each kind of card gives you different items that are important for managing your board game caf&eacute;.\n\nDuring each turn of the \"Opening the Door\" phase, each player plays a card from their hand that they acquired during the first phase; players must play a different color than what's already been played, with higher numbers also being important. Hope that you prepared well! At the end of a turn, each player can use one action disk from their action bar to perform one specific action. After this phase ends, players undergo a final scoring, then add their coins to see who has the most money and has won the game.\n\nTry to find the right balance between all the elements needed for a caf&eacute;!\n\n&mdash;description from designer\n\n"

            "description": "Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.\n\nThis entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.\n\nIn the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\n\nOn a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \"fields\" in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\n\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \"beanometer\" for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\n\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\n\n"

Players gain Friendship Points to unlock the ability to Talk It Out&mdash;a critical moment that reveals the Demon. Once revealed, the Demon becomes more powerful, triggering effects and escalating tension. Each round is framed by a Diurnal Cycle, representing limited time before the Possessed is lost for good.\n\nGoal\nPlayers must work together to heal the Possessed, endure unpredictable events, and deal damage to the Demon using action cards. Victory comes only if the Demon is defeated before time runs out. Fail, and the Possessed is lost to darkness.\n\nTone & Feel\nWhile rich in theme, the game emphasizes teamwork, planning, and clever card play over storytelling. Expect tension, tough decisions, and satisfying cooperation&mdash;not a narrative, but an experience shaped by your choices.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n"

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an \"Awesome Point\", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.\n\nThis, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like \"Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor\".\n\nIn addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are \"Pick 2\" or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.\n\nFrom the website:\n\n\"Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.\"\n\n"

A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.\n\nDuring each round, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:\n\n    take a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board\n    take a settlement tile from the staging area and place in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, \n    deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice\n    take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.  \n\n\nIn addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board.\n\nThe game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.

Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\n\nSet-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\n\nA turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.\n\n"

Not in this naughty game of cards - in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.\n\nIn Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug - which stays on the table throughout the game - and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.\n\nOn a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.\n\nThere's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug - and only him! - can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.\n\nCheating is a necessity as the \"Cheating Moth\" cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)\n\nThe action cards work as follows:\n\n\n    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.\n    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.\n    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.\n    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.\n\n\nWhen one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\n"

            "description": "You are head of a family in an Italian city-state, a city run by a weak and corrupt court. You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...\n\nIn Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.\n\nEach player starts the game with two coins and two influence - i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:\n\n\n     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.\n     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.\n     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.\n     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.\n     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\nOn your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:\n\n\n     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.\n     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.\n     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)\n\n\nWhen you take one of the character actions - whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action - that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.\n\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\n\nThe last player to still have influence - that is, a face-down character - wins the game!\n\nA new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.\n\n\n     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck. They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck. Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\n"

This increases tension in the early stages for four or more players, and 15 additional character cards allows Coup to be better played with up to ten players.\n\nWith Coup: Reformation, each player must declare themself either Loyalist or Reformist (Catholic and Reformist in the first edition) and can target only members of the other faction. Conversion is possible, however, for yourself or for another player by paying a charitable donation to the Treasury (Almshouse). Like all factions, once you have eliminated or converted the other group, you just descend into in-fighting, so there's still only one winner and no second place.\n\nCoup: Reformation adds a new fluid team dynamic to Coup as players jostle with their allegiance to take advantage or seek protection in the early stages of the game.\n\n"

Each new set that is created is stacked crosswise on top of the previous set, covering, and protecting, all the sets beneath it.\n\nThe top set of assets in your pile is vulnerable, and can be stolen by other players if they show you a matching asset card, or wild (which are Silver and Gold cards) from their hand. You can defend your stack by showing the challenger a matching card from your own hand. If you do, they can counter with another matching card of their own. The battle rages back and forth until one player can't respond, or bows out.\n\nIf you win, you keep the set, if the challenger wins, they take the set. Regardless of who wins, ALL the cards used in the challenge are added to the set, increasing its value and allure to other players.\n\nTo keep the set from being stolen by another player, the best thing you can do is to Cover Your Assets, by creating a new pair from your hand, or by stealing a set from the top of another player's stack during your next turn.\n\nAt the end of the round scores are tallied, the cards are shuffled, and a new round begins. The first player to reach $1,000,000 wins!\n\nCover Your Assets is quick to learn, and simple to play, yet surprisingly addictive and strategic. The game plays with 4-6 players, and is a great for mixed groups as kids, teens, parents, and grandparents alike can learn the game in minutes and enjoy it for hours.\n\nThe 2021 edition contains advanced rules, new cards, and rules for 2 & 3 players!\n\nBe warned: This is not a good game for sore losers!\n\n"

Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!\n\nThe Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!\n\nFind out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!\n\nRoles\n\nForensic Scientist x1\nAs the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.\n\nDuring the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.\n\nMurderer x1\nWhen the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo; respectively.\n\nThe Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.\n\nInvestigators x8\nTo solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).\n\nBear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.\n\nAccomplice x1\nThe Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.\n\nWitness x1\nThe Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.\n\nIf the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.\n\n"

In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are \"pig\", \"candy\", \"tent\", and \"son\", then I might say \"Sam-striped-pink\" and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.\n\nStarting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, \"sucker-prince-stake\". The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)\n\nThe rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.\n\n"

If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure. Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.\n\nGame Objective\nThe game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner. In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine. You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning. You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.\n\nTurn Progression\nOn their turns, players conduct steps 1-4 listed below. Players take turns, going clockwise around the board, and the round ends when all players have returned to the submarine, or if the air runs out at the beginning of someone's turn.\n\n1) Declare if you will turn back or not.\n2) Reduce air.\n3) Roll the dice and advance your game piece.\n4) Search. (When you have stopped moving, select one of A-C below)\n     A) Do nothing.\n     B) Pick up ruins chip.\n     C) Place a ruins chip.\n\n"

            "description": "Dungeon of Mandom VIII is a press-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.\n\nThe game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.\n\nThe start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.\n\nThe player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose. The players then reshuffle all the cards to make a new monster deck and use the same or a different hero to start the boasting once again.\n\nThe game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last person standing.\n\nDungeon of Mandom VIII includes the material in the original Dungeon of Mandom as well as seven new heroes, seven new monsters, and forty new pieces of equipment, with those items having previously appeared in Welcome to the Dungeon and Welcome Back to the Dungeon.\n\n"

Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points.

Players simultaneously collect newspaper tiles, stacking them on their desks until they think they have what they need to make the perfect front page.

When everything is just right, they yell &ldquo;Print&rdquo; to be the first off the press and gain their choice of centerpiece for the next round! This hectic spatial puzzle features over 100 unique newspaper tiles, 6 characters with their own special abilities, as well as 3 decks of Breaking News cards &mdash; so that each and every time you play you will be solving a new puzzle!\n\nIf real-time games aren't your style, Fit to Print has a number of alternative modes to satisfy every type of puzzle gamer.

During the collection phase, as the active player you draw cards one at a time, keeping one for yourself, placing one in an auction pile, and placing the others face up for the other players to draft. Once you take a card, you can't take another, so sometimes it's a tough call to decide when you want to take something. Once you've had multiple collection phases, the cards in the auction pile will be auctioned one by one.\n\nSome cards are worth points depending on their color, some are worth gold, and some allowing you to manipulate the value of the various colors. Once all the cards have been auctioned, players reveal their hands and tally their points to see who wins.\n\n"

The pagoda housed the four Gods and towered strong over the magnificent kingdom. As time passed, the queen fell ill, and she summoned her people to compete for her crown. The crown would be passed on to the person who could build the most pristine garden around the pagoda. The heir would be chosen by the four Gods themselves.\n\nThe goal of Four Gardens is to accumulate the most points on the score board by completing landscape cards and finishing sets. Each finished set creates a panoramic view of a garden, and these sets are called (no surprise) \"panoramas\".\n\nPlayers can finish panoramas by first laying groundwork cards, acquiring resources by turning the 3D pagoda, and allocating those resources to satisfy the requirements of each groundwork card. Once satisfied, a groundwork card becomes a landscape card. Multiple landscape cards laid in the correct order create a panorama. Each God has their own satisfaction meter which expresses their goodwill towards the gardens and their builders. Players try to please the Gods by completing landscape cards and finishing panoramas.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n"

Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf&eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf&eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.\n\nThe start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.\n\nBut no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.\n\nWith 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.\n\n"

Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.\n\nIf one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress. However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the game.\n\nPlanning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you'll need to win this cooperative game for two to five players.\n\n"

The game also features a unique optional dexterity element that adds to the game's overall tension and dread. Before a visitor can take their turn, they need to avoid making noise by stacking a small disc on top the previous ones; if the tower collapses, they've made noise and it instantly becomes Hako Onna's turn.\n\nHako Onna can win the game in two ways:\n\n    If all visitors are turned into Hakobito, or\n    If she has made it impossible for the visitors to win.\n\n\nThe human players can win in one of three ways:\n\n    If they manage to kill Hako Onna after finding her only weakness,\n    If they find the secret exit, while in posession of the key ring hidden inside the safe, or\n    If they can bring peace to Hako Onna by bringing the remains of her body to her precious doll, Mary.\n\n\nSince its original publication in Japanese, Hako Onna has reached its fourth edition, and has been republished in English by WizKids.

There is a 4-card limit per player. After their turn, refill with a new set of 3 tokens and a new Animal card if needed.\n\nPlacement of the terrain tokens will depend on the personal Animal card goals, and scoring rules for the various terrain types (mountain, field, forest, etc). For example, mountain tiles score based on how high they are (1 tile scores 1, while 3 tiles stacked score 7), but the mountain scores zero if it is not adjacent to at least one other mountain. If all the cubes on a given Animal card have been placed, the card is set aside and a new card can be drawn. The cards are scored at game end based on the highest number that isn't covered by a cube.\n\nThe games ends when there are no tokens left in the bag to refill the central area, or at least one players has 2 or fewer empty spaces on their player board. Play continues until all players have had an equal turn that round. The player with the highest points is the winner.\n\nOptionally, you can use Nature's Spirit cards for richer gameplay. During setup, each player chooses 1 of 2 spirit cards and places a Spirit cube on the card. They follow the same placement rules as Animal cards, but tend to have an ongoing effect once completed.

Will you be able to find all the communists before your studio is shut down? Or will you be suspected yourself and banned from the industry?\n\nIn the game each player will secretly be a Patriot, Communist, or Rising Star. Each round every player will have a unique Job to perform (such as the Screenwriter, Gaffer, Director, Actor, Editor, etc). These jobs will affect what kind of movie is getting made that round, what cards are in players' hands, and who will receive special information. Players can choose to skip their jobs to instead re-roll any two of the dice in the game. At the end of each round the players with stars showing on their dice will get to add a card into the movie.\n\nThe added cards will be shuffled, one will be removed, and the rest will be revealed. The team with the majority of revealed symbols (including the symbols on that round's movie poster) wins the round! Indicate the winning team for the round by placing that team's matching film-strip over the movie poster. The first team to win 4 rounds wins the game! The Rising Star plays both sides by trying to make the game go to 7 rounds and making the 7th round a tie.\n\nHollywood 1947 is a social deduction game. You must never show your cards or loyalty to anyone, but you may say whatever you'd like about the cards you put into a movie, or about your true allegiance. Open discussion about which cards were added into a movie is encouraged. However, if you are a Communist or the Rising Star, lying will often help you accomplish your goals since the majority of players will be Patriots.\n\nThat's a wrap. Most players get the hang of the game after only a few minutes. So let's go make some movies, but be careful who you trust!\n\nHollywood 1947 is the 5th standalone game in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games.

            "description": "In a Grove &mdash; a.k.a. 藪の中, Yabunonaka, and Hattari &mdash; is a game of bluffing and deduction, and the player who makes too many false accusations loses the game.\n\nThe game is played in rounds. Each round, each player receives one of the eight silhouettes (which are numbered 2-8 with one blank), while three silhouettes are placed in the center of the table as suspects and the final silhouette is dubbed the victim. (With three players, the #2 is removed from the game.) You have to determine which suspect is the culprit, either to accuse him or to lure the other players into accusing someone who's innocent!\n\nAll players secretly look at their silhouettes, then pass them right, then look at the new silhouette they received. The first player of the round secretly looks at two of the three suspects, optionally swapping the victim for one of these suspects. This player then places a colored accusation marker below one of the suspects. The next player looks at the two suspects not just marked with an accusation marker, then places a colored accusation marker of their own, covering any markers already beneath that suspect. This continues until all four players have placed an accusation marker, with each player not being allowed to look at the suspect just accused.\n\nThe round ends, and players reveal the suspects. Who's the culprit? The suspect bearing the highest number - except if the #5 is among the suspects, in which case the suspect with the lowest number is guilty. (The suspect with no number is always innocent.) Anyone who has accused the correct suspect receives their accusation marker back. Any markers incorrectly placed are flipped colored-side down and given to the player who owns the marker on top of the stack. The first player token rotates clockwise, then a new round begins.\n\nAt the end of a turn if a player has eight or more tokens &mdash; or has no tokens &mdash; then the game ends, and that player loses.\n\nEarlier editions of In a Grove supported 3-4 players, while the 2021 edition contains slight changes to the rules and components to allow for play with 2-5 people.\n\n"

No pressure!\n\nEach round players will be faced with an obstacle that they must overcome as a group. On their turn, a player may contribute a card to the obstacle, place a card on their own personal setback, or play a card for a special ability. At the end of each round players will resolve the obstacle in either an astronaut victory, a sequid victory, or a neutral outcome. If the astronauts or sequids achieve 3 victories they immediately win. If neither team reaches 3 victories before round seven, players have a chance to launch the rocket. Every player that has completed their personal setback boards the rocket and attempt to make it back to Earth. Before the launch though, players will have one final chance to vote off any infected players that have infiltrated the rocket.\n\nDepending on skill level, players may elect to play a simple game as an astronaut trying to escape Mars, or a more challenging game as one of 9 unique superheros attempting to protect those astronauts. Superheroes have more power, but they're playing a tougher game. You know what they say about power, responsibility, etc. Each player's choice to be an astronaut or hero makes no change to the overall balance of the game!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n"

            "description": "The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game is a co-operative card game that plays out over eighteen chapters that lead players through the events of the novel The Fellowship of the Ring. The chapters can be played in any order, but ideally you play them in sequence.\n\nIn each chapter, each player takes a different character role &mdash; Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Farmer Maggot, etc. &mdash; and each character has a condition that must be met in order to pass the chapter and advance in the story. Frodo needs to capture ring cards, for example, while Pippin wants to take as few tricks as possible. As you advance through the chapters, new characters, items, and challenges are introduced to the game.\n\nThe deck consists of 37 cards, with one card being set aside as \"lost\" each hand. Whoever is dealt the One Ring becomes Frodo, then other players choose from the available characters based on their hand. The One Ring is the game's only trump card, but initially rings can't be led until someone plays one off-suit.\n\nIn the two-player game, one hand of cards is dealt to a dummy player, with some cards being face up and others face down. This dummy is assigned a character, and one of the human players will play cards for it based on which cards are free to be played.\n\nIn the solitaire game, one player plays four hands of face-up cards, with each hand being assigned a character and only a few cards being available at a time. After you play a trick, deal each hand a new card.\n\nIf you own The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game, you can add the following characters to this version of the Road Goes Ever On...:\nBilbo (Peculiar), Gandalf (Grey Wizard), Gildor Inglorion, Fatty Bolger, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Barliman, Glorfindel, Bill the Pony, Gl&oacute;in, Arwen, Boromir (Captain of Gondor), Gwaihir, Shadowfax (Lord of Horses), Radagast, Gandalf (Servant of the Secret Fire), Galadriel, and Celeborn.\n\n"

            "description": "Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2-10 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.\n\n"

Each player becomes a coach of a football team, confronting each other. The game consists of two Rounds; 1st half and 2nd half. Each round consists of several turns.\n\nIn your turn, you basically place a Player Card on the Field Board. The meaning of Player Card placement is an expression of where the team is currently focused on and which player is the center of the tactics. Each Player Card has semicircular tactical icons which can be combined with the icons on other Player Cards. Therefore, each team will have more tactical icons according to the combination of the Player Cards, as the turns go on.\n\nThere are 4 different type of tactical icons- Attack, Defence, Pass, and Press- and the action and the effect you may take in your turn vary according to the type and amount of the icons you have been made. Based on the tactical icons you have, you may 1) attempt a shot, 2) draw Synergy Cards, and 3) push the Control Maker on the Control Track.\n\nWhen you attempt a shot, compare your attack power and the opponent's defence power. Both of attack/defence power can be strengthened with the Synergy Cards that each player has. The Synergy Cards represent the teamwork and the passing play of the team. And if your Control is high enough, you may add more Synergy Cards to the attack power. If the total of the attack power is higher than the defence power, as a result, it's a goal!\n\nIn case you made the total attack power exactly 11, it called a Magic Number, or Wonder Goal, so the opponent can't defend the shot even with the higher defence power. On the other hand, if it exceeds 11, it's always no goal bacause the shot was too strong to be on target. Since there is always at least ONE unknown Synergy Card which has to be played from deck, so you can't guarantee the outcome of the shot!\n\nA round ends when all the Synergy Cards run out. When the 2nd round ends, a team with higher score wins!\n\n&mdash;description from the designer\n\n"

            "description": "In Reiner Knizia's Mille Fiori (millefiori is a glasswork technique for decorative patterns, the name means Thousand Flowers), you take the role of glass manufacturers and traders who want to profit as much as they can from their role in the production of fine glass art.\n\nThe game board features different aspects of the glass production cycle: workshops where the glass is created, houses where it's installed, people who support your work, trade shops where it's sold, and the harbor where ships take the glass to faraway locations. You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.\n\nAt the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round's start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:\n\n\n     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.\n     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.\n     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.\n     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.\n     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.\n\nEach player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.\n\nFor each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!\n\nAdditionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.\n\nWhen someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.\n\n"

It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.\n\nIn more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\n\nYou start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!\n\nFor an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down. You don't look at the cards played until the end of a level, losing lives at that time for cards played out of order.\n\n"

Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives. Of course, the detectives must identify Jack, who must stay hidden long enough to escape.\n\n"

In Night of the Ninja, your mission is to defeat a rival ninja House ...if you can figure out who they are!  Each round, you choose your ninja role: a Spy or Fortune Teller gains valuable information, but only a Shinobi or Blind Assassin can cut down an opponent. To win, you'll have to trick your opponents, figure out who can't be trusted, and fight for your House!\n\nNight of the Ninja supports 4-11 players, and a single round can play out within 5 minutes. Created by Justin Gary (Ascension, Shards of Infinity), it's designed to appeal to anyone from novice gamers to social deduction enthusiasts. Every card features papercraft art by Ben Charman, intricately hand-cut and photographed to create a unique, evocative visual style.\n\nNight of the Ninja offers several twists on the social deduction genre. The team-based play means you can win Honor even if you die, as long as your House prevails. Each round begins by drafting Ninja cards, and no role is strictly better than others. The deadliest cards are also the last to be played, and gathering information can be as valuable as assassinating another player.\n\nNight of the Ninja contains everything needed for up eleven players: 33 Ninja cards, 11 House cards, 11 Player standees, and 35 Honor tokens.\n\n"

Each turn, players have two options:\n\n    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card\n    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card\n\n\nHowever, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.\n\nThe first versions of the game supported up to five players, but the German 2011 edition supports up to seven (simply by increasing the number of chips).\n\nThis game was originally published in Germany in 2004 by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's 2006 international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English. The game has subsequently been released in other countries under an assortment of names. The German 2024 edition includes additional cards to allow for play with variant rules.\n\n"

They have the power to bend human traits to their will, and they will always battle between each other to create the perfect symmetry between virtues and vices of humankind. You will now choose whether to find the best balance &mdash; or completely crush it for your own good.\n\nOverseers is a drafting and bluffing game with a twist. Each player represents an Overseer whose objective is to bend traits in their favor to create the most dominant combination of virtues and vices. The game has three main phases:\n\n1] Drafting: Each player receives six cards at random from the deck, selects one of them, then passes the rest to the player sitting on their left. The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points.\n\n2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:\n\n&mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination.\n&mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile.\n\n3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score.\n\nThe game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player's hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another.\n\nAt the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins.\n\n"

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.\n\nOn a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\n\nIn addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \"button income\": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.\n\nWhat's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.\n\nAdditionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)\n\nWhen a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.\n\n"

Your entire purpose in life is to expand, sire other clouds and water crops. Unfortunately, your mates (who are also clouds) have a similar plan. It's up to you to manipulate the weather and assimilate these rogue clouds to contribute to the growth of as many crops as possible - all in order to claim the title of Most Valuable Cloud.\n\nPetrichor is a highly interactive board game, playable by 1-4 people (up to 5 with the expansion, see below). It's an action selection/area influence game, with 4 simple actions which interact with the various fields in ever surprising ways. The players move clouds with water droplets, and then rain those droplets onto specific fields, to make sure they have the right amount of water for the Harvest. During a Harvest, crops that have been watered enough are scored! Players are able to influence when, and how often the harvest happens. Players need to strike a fine balance between maintaining control of the different fields as well as influencing Harvest, to make sure the two come together at the optimal time.\n\nSolo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi\n\n"

But when someone declares bankruptcy, the remaining fraudster who forged the biggest shell corporation wins the game!\n\nIn more detail, on each turn, players must take one new Fund card from the Funding boards along with a corresponding Industry tile and cash as indicated on the card. You need to pay the \"promised reward\" of each Fund card in a number of rounds. After all players have taken their Fund cards, they may choose to initiate an \"inside trade\" with one other player in order to buy the Industry you want with a price they can't refuse, or sell your own Industry to them with a good price.\n\nAt the end of the round, players rotate their Time Wheel 1 or 2 spaces, and pay the \"promised reward\" to the bank if any Fund card is due.\n\nThe game continues until at least one player cannot pay the \"promised reward\" due and goes bankrupt.

After World War II, Hertzano immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) and developed the first sets with his family. Over the years, the Hertzano family licensed it to other countries and Rummikub became Israel's best-selling export game.\n\nHertzano's Official Rummikub Book, published in 1978, describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra, and International. Modern Rummikub sets include only the Sabra version rules, with no mention of the others, and there are variations in the rules between publishers.\n\nIn Turkey, the game is known as Okey and is widely played by families at gatherings or at local cafes.\n\nLike Rummy that you play with cards, you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).\n\n"

The liberal team always has a majority.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.\n\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\n\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.\n\n"

In a last ditch attempt, it is looking to hire a top tier business consultant to turn this around. Alas, there are many such persons claiming to be the best. To filter mere noise from the elite, the company has called upon the consultants with the most potential to share their business proposals - You are one such.\n\nShake Up sits in a very rare tabletop genre: reverse deck-building or also known as a deck destruction game. Players each have their own deck of cards, which are completely identical decks since they represent the same employees of the same IT company. How each player handles the company will be different though, and that is where the better consultant will stand out. The first consultant to put the company into the green wins!\n\nEvery turn players draw 4 cards from their own deck, and determine how to utilize those cards' abilities. Players are also allowed to perform a 'Lay Off' action, permanently removing an employee from the deck. While this may seem bad, it makes their deck more efficient in the style they want to build towards. They also save on that employee's salary, especially if it is a highly paid executive! Note however, that the higher ups usually have greater experience and better abilities. Starting off the game with some debt, players will slowly clear them away as well as make some profit through new business projects. How then do consultants interact in the game? Their sales folks can try to hustle the other team, messing up their rivals' business proposals! Of course, those same rivals will likely also have their own purchasing and accounting departments to protect themselves from red herring purchases.\n\nWhen does the game end? Each time a player's draw deck is emptied and recycled from its discard pile, she has a chance to call an Audit. When an Audit is called, that player counts her total revenue earned, then reduce it by the salary of all existing employees in her deck, as well as any unpaid loans. If it is still positive, she wins the game right away! Dare you call an Audit before your rival? Doing so is risky, since you either win the game right away or you gain more debt because you have to pay for wasting the auditors' time, putting you further from victory.\n\n\n    Deck-builders are a common genre and folks try to add more powerful and advanced cards into their deck, which is typically comprised of basic cards. In reverse deck-building however, players begin with fully powered-up decks. The problem is one where veteran deck-builders will be familiar with - having too thick a deck will make it inefficient. Throughout the game, players will try to cull cards that are not part of their chosen strategy.\n\n\n"

Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful as everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first.\n\nSilver Fang is a traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with each player being able to choose and see two of their cards. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.\n\nOn a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.\n\nSilver Fang can be played as a standalone game or combined with other games in the Silver series by B&eacute;zier Games. Each version of the game has different card abilities and a different silver token ability.\n\nSilver Fang is unique because it includes team rules and cards that, while they work for individual player games, can be leveraged for team play. The Silver Fang token creates a personal discard pile that can only be accessed by the Fang owner, providing a place for them and their teammate to play cards that only the Fang owner can choose from.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n"

Other players can then overbid them, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with their own. If they show only roses, they win; if they reveal a skull, they lose, placing one of their cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull & Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.\n\nSkull & Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull & Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull & Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull & Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.\n\n"

            "description": "Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.\n\nSkull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, two Mermaids, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).\n\nStandard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.\n\nIf a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.\n\n"

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use only the lowest 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know exactly which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and know what to expect so that you can (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.\n\n"

Instead the game introduces reminiscence cards, representing memorial events, like \"Camp Fire\", \"Watching the stars\", \"Picnic\", etc. These cards are worth substantial victory points, but unlike the other victory points they are not bought with love, but gained by discarding a specified number of maid cards from your hand, thus introducing the possibility of getting victory points from pure maid cards, previously not possible.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you've talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven't told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they'll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you've seen your friends' loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\n\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\n\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\n\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.\n\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

Try to build as many houses as you can while keeping in mind which houses in your hand can be built at the end.\n\nIn Town 77, each player has a hand of tiles, with each tile showing one of seven house styles in one of seven colors/patterns. (The color/pattern of a tile also shows on its reverse side.) The game has 49 tiles in total, one of each possible combination. Each player starts with a hand of random tiles.\n\nThe first player places a tile in the upper-left corner of an imaginary 7x7 square, then on each subsequent turn a player adds a tile to a row or column in this square so long as this tile is adjacent to at least one other tile and the color/house style isn't already present in this row and column. After playing a tile, a player can choose to draw a new tile or not. Once you lower your hand size, you can't increase it again. If you can't play on a turn, you're out of the game, and once everyone is out, whoever has the fewest tiles in hand &mdash; or who played latest in the event of a tie &mdash; wins.\n\nIf you play your final tile, you win, but if you don't draw new tiles, you might find yourself unable to play!\n\n"

In TROLL, each player takes the role of a thief, trying to steal precious jewels from the hideous troll.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of six tokens, with numbers from 0 to 5. Depending the number of the players, some troll cards are not used (Troll cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). On a round, players attempt to steal from the target troll by playing his or her tokens in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target troll (the top troll card) and plays one of his number tokens face up. If he or she plays a \"3\" token, it means that the player intends to steal 3 jewels from the target troll. Next players have two options: 1) look at the troll card just as the first player did and play a number token face up; or 2) play a number token face down, take a multiplier (x2) token from the pool, and put the multiplier token on his or her face down number token.\n\nAfter all the players played their number tokens, the troll card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the troll is \"9\" and Amy played \"3\", Becky \"5\", Carlos \"2\", and Dave \"3\" with \"x2\" multiplier on it, Carlos (2), Amy (3), and Dave (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) jewels respectively. However, Becky will receive a penalty point (-2), since she woke up the troll. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the troll's rampage.\n\nPlay continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds/days (set of rounds), depending the number of the players. The player with the most jewels at the game end is the winner.\n\n"

With time, Alchemists started to settle in this region, studying the marvelous properties of local wildlife. Years of experience and failed experiments brought them to the mastery of preparation of exquisite mixtures. Their skills grow with each newfound ingredient and acquired knowledge bear fruit in new mixtures. For the Valley hides much more undiscovered secrets. Each year, when Winter leaves the Valley and Mother Spring wakes the World to life anew, Alchemists arrange a slight contest of mixture preparation. There's no lack of mixture recipients and enthusiasts, and domesticated mystical beings ceaselessly spread the fruit of the hard alchemic work to the whole World. It is you, my dear Player, who will have the honor to take the role of one of the greatest Alchemists known to this World. Learn and strive for greatness, and maybe it will be you who wins the Spring contest and with it, the title of the best Alchemist in the Valley for the whole upcoming year.\n\nThe game is made up of a series of player turns, that are played one by one, starting with the First Player and continuing clockwise.\n\nOn their turn, a player can perform any 2 actions out of the 5 available ones; the chosen actions can be carried out in any order and combination.

Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful. Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n\nViticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas & Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes.\n\n"

For generations, your people have known and lived with the ice whales and together you've bought and traded at the busy ports along the fabled Ice Coast. You are honored to be the latest in your family to sail with the whales &mdash; but the ice is thickening and the glaciers are moving. A deep winter is coming, the fiercest for centuries. You decide to ride your mount one final time before the snows come to buy and sell as much as you can...and maybe even collect some precious pearls along the way.\n\nWhale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasure, or will you make your money slowly along the way?\n\nEach player has two actions per turn, but a lot they want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game ends and the player with the most pearls wins!\n\nWhale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players.\n\n&mdash;description from publisher\n\n"

Become a good spirit and help the Dreamer by giving him clues about the dream before the naughty spirits mess it up. Close your eyes and dive in!\n\nAt the beginning of each round of When I Dream one player takes the role of the Dreamer and \"falls asleep\", wearing a cloth mask. The other players are secretly dealt their role cards determining what kind of spirits they are \"good\" or  \"naughty\" or if they are just \"tricksters\" changing sides as the game goes by.\n\nThe whole round lasts 120 seconds in which the spirits are drawing \"Dream\" cards depicting a specific element of the dream, trying to describe them to the dreamer using one word each. The dreamer can guess what the element of the Dream is at any time, placing the card to the good spirits team side if the guess was correct and in the naughty spirits pile if it was not. \nAt the end of the round the Dreamer and the good spirits get a point for every card in the good spirits pile, when the naughty spirits get one point for every card in the naughty spirits pile. The tricksters get points according to how well balanced the two teams were at the end of the round, gaining extra points if they managed to equally balance the two piles.\n\nAt the end of the round, the dreamer must use the words he guessed and story-tell his dream for extra points before he opens his eyes.\n\nYou can learn how to play in a few minutes and have a great laugh right from the start. Each role is challenging and entertaining giving the game more depth according to the player's imagination, providing a wonderful experience with a unique dream every round.\n\n"

The challenges are simple, but there's a catch: Before a player begins a challenge, their friends bet on how difficult the challenge can be made without failing. The friend who makes the challenge the hardest becomes that player's teammate, and they both score if the player can successfully complete the challenge. However, if they upped the stakes too high and the challenger fails, then all other players earn a point, and the challenger and their teammate both lose points. Success is based entirely on whether players are good judges of their friends' abilities.\n\n"

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose \"no trump\". On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.\n\nThe playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.\n\nAfter each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.\n\nAfter all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.\n\nA common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.\n\n"
